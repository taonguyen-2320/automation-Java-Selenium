- Create a class called Circle with a variable called radius with type float
- In this class, create a constructor receiving a float argument and in the body, set the radius variable with that parameter
- Create a main method, instantiate a new Circle instance with no argument constructor, is it allowed?
- Add a float into the constructor calling, then print the radius of this Circle instance
- Create another constructor with no argument, in the body, set the radius variable with value 2.0
- In the main method, instantiate another Circle instance with no argument constructor, is it allowed now?
- Print the radius of the second Circle instance
- Beside setting directly the default value to the radius in the no argument constructor, are there any other ways to do so?
