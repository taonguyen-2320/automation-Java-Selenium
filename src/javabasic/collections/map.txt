- Give 1 example of when we should use Map in test automation
- Create a HashMap<String, Son>
- Add 3 entries to this map, the value should be an instance of Son and the key should be the name of this instance
- Loop through the map and print out son and father name
- Add more instances to the first map
- Create a HashMap<String, ArrayList<Son>>, the key should be the father name and the value should be the list of Son
- Loop through the first map to add appropriate entries to the second map
