- Give 1 example of when we should use Set and 1 example of when we should use List in test automation
- Create a HashSet with generic type Son (created in previous exercise)
- Add 3 instances of Son class to this set
- Use 3 different way (for with index, for with : and while) to call each instance's """"introduction"""" method
- Create a Son variable and assign a new instances of Son class with same name and father name as an instance already added to the set
- Add this variable to the set
- Print the set length, is it 3 or 4? If 3, why? And if 4, why when we have 2 instances with same name and father name?
- Add the variable again to the set, print the set length. Is it increased by 1? If yes, why? If no, why?
