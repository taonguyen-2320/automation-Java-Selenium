- Create an ArrayList with generic type Son (created in previous exercise)
- Add 3 instances of Son class to this array
- Use 3 different way (for with index, for with : and while) to call each instance's ""introduction"" method
- Create an ArrayList with generic type Father
- Add 1 instance of Father and 1 instance of Son to this array
- Why can we add the instance of Son to a Father array?
- Find another way to loop through the list without using looping keywords like ""for"" or ""while""
