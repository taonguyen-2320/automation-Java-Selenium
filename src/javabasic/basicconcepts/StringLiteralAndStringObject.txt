Based on what we learned in this video, if I have a class called Employee. Then I create 2 new instances of this class:
    Employee emp1 = new Employee(""Phuong"", ""Lam"");
    Employee emp2 = new Employee(""Phuong"", ""Lam"");
    System.out.println(emp1==emp2);
What will be the output result? And why?
